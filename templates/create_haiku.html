<h2>Write your own Haiku</h2>       
<p class="text-center mt-5">
    Writing a haiku is simple and with some practice a lot of fun.
    Just follow this basic structure as the minimal rule set, everything else 
    is up to you! 
</p>
<p>Use three lines for your haiku.</p>
<p>The first and third line have 5 syllables each</p>
<p>Your haiku shouldn't rhyme</p>
<p>Traditionally a cutting word, called a <em>kireji</em> is included
    as well as a seasonal reference. In this modern however not all topics warrent
    a seasonal reference and in order to make easier for beginners a <em>kireji</em>
    is not mandetory.
</p>
<p>Just tag your haiku with one of the subject provided and don't worry about anything
    else. Have fun!
</p>
