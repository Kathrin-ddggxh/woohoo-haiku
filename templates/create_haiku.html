<h2>Write your own Haiku</h2>  
<div class="container-fluid my-0 mx-auto w-75 text-center">   
    <p class="my-3 mx-auto w-50">
        Writing a haiku is simple and with some practice a lot of fun.
        Just follow this basic structure as the minimal rule set, everything else 
        is up to you! 
    </p>
    <p>Use three lines for your haiku.</p>
    <p>The first and third line have 5 syllables each</p>
    <p>Your haiku shouldn't rhyme</p>
    <p>Traditionally a cutting word, called a <em>kireji</em> is included
        as well as a seasonal reference. In this modern however not all topics warrent
        a seasonal reference and in order to make easier for beginners a <em>kireji</em>
        is not mandetory.
    </p>
    <p>Just tag your haiku with one of the subject provided and don't worry about anything
        else. Have fun!
    </p>
